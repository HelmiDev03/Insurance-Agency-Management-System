## Introduction

The project aims to develop a web-based insurance management system to streamline the process of insurance subscription and management. While the original project was conducted as part of the Mutuelle Assurance de lâ€™Enseignement (MAE), this documentation focuses solely on the technical aspects of the application, excluding any reference to the summer internship.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for home insurance subscription requests.
- Efficient response handling for added home insurance requests.
- Integration of ChartJs for visually representing statistical data.

## Technologies

The project leveraged the following technologies:

- Django framework for building a secure and robust web application.
- ChartJs for creating interactive and visually appealing data charts.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the successful development of an insurance management application. The use of Django as the framework and ChartJs for data visualization have been instrumental in creating a secure, efficient, and visually engaging system.

While this documentation does not discuss the internship context, it highlights the technical achievements and potential for future enhancements in various domains. The project paves the way for exploring new features and expanding the application into different areas.

We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in web development and software engineering. Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute to its improvement.
